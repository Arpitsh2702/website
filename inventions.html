        <h1>List of Indian inventions and discoveries in modern India</h1>
        <h3>This list of Indian inventions and discoveries details the inventions, 
        scientific discoveries and contributions of India
         including those from the historic Indian subcontinent and the modern-day republic of India.</h3>
        <h2>Computers and programming languages</h2> 
        <p> 1. <b>Visual J#</b> – A transitional programming language for programmers of Java and Visual J++ languages.
          It was developed by the Hyderabad-based Microsoft India Development Center at HITEC City in India</p>
        <p>2. <b>Julia </b>is a high-level, dynamic programming language. Its features are well suited for numerical analysis and computational science Kojo –
             A programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) for computer programming and learning.
        <p>3. <b>Kojo</b> is an open-source software. It was created, and is actively developed, by Lalit Pant</p>
        <p>4. <b>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) </b>– A standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. 
            Abhay Bhushan is the author of the File Transfer Protocol (which he started working on while he was a student at IIT-Kanpur)</p>
        <p>5. <b>TCS BaNCS</b>, was one of the first core banking software started implemented in late 1970s and released in early 80s. </p>
        <h2>Space</h2>
        <pre>1. Although the presence of water ice on the Moon has been conjectured by various scientists since the 1960s.
2. Saha ionisation equation – The Saha equation, derived by the Bengali scientist Meghnad Saha (6 October 1893 – 16 February 1956) in 1920.
3. Quasi-normal modes of black holes – C. V. Vishveshwara discovered the quasi-normal modes of black holes.
4. Chandrasekhar limit: Subramanyan Chandrasekhar discovered the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star.
        </pre>
        <h2>Mathematics</h2>
        <pre>1. Ramanujan theta function, Ramanujan prime, Ramanujan summation,
Ramanujan graph and Ramanujan's sum – Discovered by the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan in the early 20th century
2. Basu's theorem – The Basu's theorem, a result of Debabrata Basu (1955) states that any complete sufficient statistic
is independent of any ancillary statistic.
3. Kosaraju's algorithm is a linear time algorithm to find the strongly connected components of a directed graph. 
Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman credit it to S. Rao Kosaraju and Micha Sharir. Kosaraju suggested it in 1978.
4. Shrikhande graph – Graph invented by the Indian mathematician S.S. Shrikhande in 1959.
5. The Indian mathematician D.R.Kaprekar discovered the number 6174 is reached after repeatedly subtracting
the smallest number from the largest number that can be formed from any four digits not all the same
